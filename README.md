The app uses machine learning features of the iPhone to detect the presence of a hand in front of the phone, and then plays music.

## Installing
First clone the repo

```
Git clone 
```

Open the application in Xcode. To use the application you will need to "sideload" it onto your iPhone. Unfortunately, the Xcode phone simulator doesn't have the ability to support the camera and machine learning functionality. For more on sideloading, see this article: http://osxdaily.com/2016/01/12/howto-sideload-apps-iphone-ipad-xcode/
